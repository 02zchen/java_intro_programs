All of these programs were exercises or examples from the book " Introduction to programming in Java" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. Most of these programs are classic models of very fundamental concepts in java and have very little practical use in today's programming world. Please note that this collection is not complete and that there are a lot more exercises in the book, I have merely chosen a few to do.
